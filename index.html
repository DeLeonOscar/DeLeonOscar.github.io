                <h2>Oscar De Leon Vazquez</h2>
                <p>I currently work at Boeing as a Manufacturing Engineer supporting the 737 Program. I hold both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. My academic background includes applied research using convolutional neural networks for autonomous vehicle applications. I am interested in combining data, automation, and mechanical design to solve complex engineering problems.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I serve as the President of the SHPE Puget Sound Professional Chapter. In this role, I lead a team of directors in creating events that promote Hispanic representation in STEM.</p>
                <p>In my free time, you can find me playing sports—especially soccer—traveling, participating in community outreach with SHPE and Boeing, and learning new things.</p>
